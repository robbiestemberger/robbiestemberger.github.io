            <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>This portfolio website is a personal project designed to house information regarding the courses that I have taken, my personal resume, and notable projects. This was coded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        
            <h2>Vinyl Record DBMS</h2>
            <p>A collaborative project in which a database was designed to store information pertaining to vinyl records. This project evolved several times over the course of ten weeks.</p>
            <p>The first version of this project involved integration between Microsoft Access and MySQL. This version featured basic information associated with vinyl records such as track lists, artist information, band members, etc.</p>
            <p>The second version of this project involved integration between Microsoft SQL Server, ODBC, and Microsoft Access. To further refine the data, reformatting of the code was required to work with Microsoft SQL Server. Additionally, triggers and views were created to display changes in the data and would store that information. In Microsoft Access forms were created that allowed for easy access to these adjusted tables.</p>
            <p>The final version of this project took the database created and turned it into a functional CRUD based website which used XAMPP to run the website on a local host. The website was coded with JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and HTML.</p>
